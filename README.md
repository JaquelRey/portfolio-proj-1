# portfolio-proj-1
I'm working on my first portfolio website that is mobile first, responsive, and good looking. It shows my basic information, and linked examples of my work. 

While working on this project I:

        - Learned more about creating a responsive layout
        - Practiced using variuable CSS to style elements with consistancy quickly
        - Got more familiar with github

What I would improve on in the future:

    - Better use of the git repository throughout working on my project
    - More code comments that are concise 
        

This website uses:

    html:  
        for basic construction of elements and page content (including text and images)

    css:
        for styling and presenting content. Including variuable css, and a webkit for the scrollbar (which is non-standard and only supported in Blink and WebKit based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Safari / iOS)) 

    javascript:
        for the toggleable nav menu and page scrolling to sections

    boxicons:
        to add visual icon elements to the page
        https://boxicons.com/
        https://github.com/atisawd/boxicons

The site features:

    - A home landing with my name and photo.

    - Links to my linkedin, github, gitlab, and illustration portfolio.

    - A button to download my resume.

    - A nav menu that opens and closes, 
        - with scrolling links to each section of the page.
        - with a link to jump up outside of the menu

    - Several sections for:
        - About me
        
        - My skills

        - How to contact me

        - Examples of my work, with photos and links
